# mld: mozilla-lambdatest-devicepool

Detects pending Taskcluster jobs and starts tasks at Lambdatest to handle them.

Lambdatest job launching is done via their Hyperexecute CLI tool (that handles the API requests).

## Configuration

Configuring `mld` requires creating environment variables and a yaml configuration file for Bitbar. See `config/lambdatest.yml`.

## Usage

```bash
mld --help

# run locally in debug mode (no LT API jobs started)
mld --debug
```

## Deployment

### getting the hyperexecute binary

See https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/hyperexecute-cli-run-tests-on-hyperexecute-grid/.


### Systemd Unit Installation

```
sudo cp service/lambdatest.service /etc/systemd/system/lambdatest.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

## Job Tracing

Linking Taskcluster jobs to Lambdatest jobs bidrectionally.

### LT->TC

Go to the 'Post Steps' tab of the selected job in the LambdaTest Hyperexecute UI (https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/jobs). Reveal the 'Post' step's output. You should see text similar to:

```
generic-worker-metadata.json contents:
{
  "lastTaskUrl": "https://firefox-ci-tc.services.mozilla.com/tasks/Ym_uHmb0TmC_f45Wv8uw3w/runs/0"
}
```

### TC->LT

Search for `lambdatest` in the Taskcluster job's log. You should find content similar to:

```
[task 2025-06-02T22:27:14.576Z] LambdaTest Job Number: 21724
[task 2025-06-02T22:27:14.576Z] LambdaTest Job URL: https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/task?jobId=0e05dbf5-7cec-44a2-a63c-1d8c01525009&link=&logType=&order=&scenario_search_text=&taskId=HYPL-1611945-1748903159145866048AYB&taskStatus=
```

## Development Notes

TODO: Needs updating.

### execution loop overview

```bash
# overview:
#   1. do configuration / load config data
#   2. in loop:
#     a. update tc queue counts
#     b. update lt job status (how many running per group)
#     c. update lt device status (how many devices in each state per group)
#     d. calculate number of jobs to start
#     e. start jobs for the appropriate tc queue with selected devices
```

### execution loop modes

1. starts a single job, foreground, targets device_type-os_version
  - replica of jmaher's PoC
2. starts multiple jobs, --no-track, foreground, targets device_type-os_version
  - works, current default
  - known issues
    - slwo start problem: if 60 jobs come in, will take awhile to have 100% utilization (takes awhile to start jobs)
3. starts a single job with hyperexecute yaml concurrency, --no-track, foreground, targets device_type-os_version
  - didn't work (theoretically should, check with LT about my understanding of field), needs more investigation.

#### proposed modes

1. starts multiple jobs, --no-track, background, targets device_type-os_version
  - improve slow start problem
  - decision: implement
2. starts multiple jobs, --no-track, background, targets single device (device_type-os_version and udid)
  - need to track specific free devices in app
  - enables creation of multiple device pools per device type
  - discussed with jmaher... wait on this
    - don't expect need for device_type partitions at LT yet
